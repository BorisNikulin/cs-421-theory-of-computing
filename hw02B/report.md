# Boris Nikulin HW2B Report

To initialize and build, run
```
unzip *.zip; cmake -Bbuild; cd build; make;
```

The build artifacts are in `build`
as `hw2b_manual` and `hw2b_table`.
To rebuild everything,
run `make` in the build directory.
`make help` will list some valid make targets.

I added command line argument capability to both for convenience.
The manual program can take the input file to check against as the first argument.
The table drive program can take the transition table file as the first argument
and the dfa list file as the second.

a)
	
	The program works like the provided one and without major bugs.
	The outputs are as expected.
